Frieda was born and raised in Santa Fe, New Mexico. In 2004 Frieda graduated with a major in economics from Emory University (B.A., member of Omicron Delta Epsilon – Economics Honor Society). After a year spent clerking in the law, and knowing New Mexico was where she would eventually want to settle down, Frieda returned for law school and in 2008 graduated from University of New Mexico School of Law (J.D., cum laude). Frieda brings not only her love of the law and the courtroom, but her energetic approach to life to her practice, which focuses on civil litigation, specifically trust and estate litigation, real estate and property litigation, commercial and business litigation, insurance law, including insurance defense and defense of first-party bad faith claims, as well as property and commercial transactions. Frieda has two children, whom she raises with great joy.
