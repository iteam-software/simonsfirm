Prior to entering law school, Tom was a Rotary Club Scholar living in Caracas, Venezuela. Today, Tom is renowned for his love of the law, his passion for language and his tremendous success as a litigator. Tom’s straightforward style and assertive litigation skills have earned him a reputation as one of New Mexico’s top litigators.

Tom specializes in civil jury trial practice in many areas of the law, including commercial litigation, title insurance defense, real estate litigation, general insurance defense and construction related litigation.

Prior to founding the firm of Simons Cuddy & Friedman in 1979, Tom clerked for the Honorable William R.
