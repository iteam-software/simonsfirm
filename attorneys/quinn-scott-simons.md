Quinn was born and raised in Santa Fe and is a fourth generation New Mexican. After attending undergraduate school at Colorado College (B.A. 1997), Quinn, an avid mountain climber, attempted an unclimbed route on a remote, 25,245â€™ peak in the Tibetan Himalayas. Due to an unexpected storm and highly technical climbing conditions at high altitude, Quinn suffered severe frostbite, costing him his fingers and feet. Undaunted by the challenges and adversity that ensued, Quinn started and ran a successful construction company in Santa Fe for several years, before moving to Kentucky to train horses.

After years in the horse business, Quinn reunited with his high school girlfriend, Veree, and chose to settle down and raise his family in Santa Fe. Quinn attended the University of New Mexico School of Law (J.D. 2013), and now maintains a successful law practice focused on construction and real estate law and litigation, general business law and litigation, and insurance law. He is licensed to practice in both New Mexico State and Federal courts with an emphasis on trial practice.

Quinn still spends his free time with Veree and their three children, riding horses and enjoying the mountains.
